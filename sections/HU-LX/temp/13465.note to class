13465.NT after class:

it would be very good if youre occupied with further coding of not yet coded features to orientate the following scheme, i.e. to 'wrap' codes like showen, and maybe the features also. this will make it easy to extract and integrate the new codes into the transcripts or to do some statistic analysis with what we found in the second round. 
please do not convert the transcipts to .docx or any other format, try to work with them as plain .txt files. convenient editor for text files is https://atom.io


scheme, excerpt example:

*INT:	(WOMAN/CHILDREN_BALL) Was macht die Mutter? 
*GCB:	Hier die Mutter gibt zu dem Maedchen,
*GCB:	<zu die Jungen><#nst case#> <die Ball><#nst case#> und der Junge <zu die Maedchen><#nst case#> und das Maedchen, <die><#NAG#> <fangt><#NVP#> <die Ball><#nst case#>.

the wrapping of the <features> is not necessary, just if not too much effort. just wrap the <#codes#> like this.
