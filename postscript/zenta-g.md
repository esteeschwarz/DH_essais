#### 14346.2.research q.
- can a standard NER model applied to the methods of adressing/mentioning p. in FM writing be used to recognize NEs?
- how would an FM specific model look like and :why: would it differ from the standard model?
- what then are the characteristics in this aspect of FM writing?

to answering these q. we do not really have to first digitize and transcribe found material as there is already a large corpus of published work that can be used, but maybe we'll find different forms i.e. answers of above in the published vs. unpublished material
