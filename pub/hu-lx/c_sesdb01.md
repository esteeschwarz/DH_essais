# SES Database
open the database *SES\_database\_by\_tokens.xlsx* in excel or numbers (the database is about 26MByte, on a Mac choose rather Excel, the processing will be faster than in Numbers).  
in general you would prefer e.g. [OpenRefine][1] instead of excel or numbers for best working with the table.

to filter the table rows for specific tokens, speakers etc:
- open *Daten \> Filter*
- click the dropdown arrow in the column you want to filter in, e.g. p\_speaker
- deselect the „select all“ button (click on it; by default its selected with a häkchen)
	- now there should be no häkchen in any square/button
- select e.g. the speaker you want to filter for / häkchen setzen
- apply filter 
- you can apply several filters at once to limit concordance to language of interview or age or whatever limitation you want
- if you want to filter in the token column, you can put in/search for a free text token and then select what matches your search
- if you want to turn filters off you have to be again in the dropdown filter option of the column and remove the filter there, \> *filter entfernen*
